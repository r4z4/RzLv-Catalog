# RzLv-Catalog

Pento App from Programming Elixir by Chris McCurd
Further adapted for products and catalogs

A Phoenix LiveView e-commerce-like site for viewing and purchasing products. Utilizes Phoeix Presence, PubSub and Channels. This all on top of the underlying OTP and Erlang libraries that power the BEAM.

To run, clone repo and cd into src dir.
Run mix deps.get to install dependencies.

Run mix deps.update to fetch updated dependencies. For instructions if conflicts, see Elixir docs (usually override: true will solve it)

To start server, run mix phx.server
